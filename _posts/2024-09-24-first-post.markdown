## My First Post
Hello and welcome to my programming blog! I'm starting this up because I want to have a formal way to build (and showcase) my knowledge of computer science outside of my job as a software developer. I'm writing enough code nowadays that my long-form writing ability is rapidly atrophying, so I'm also hoping keeping this blog going will continue to strengthen that muscle.

## What Will You Find On Here?
This blog will be part documentation of my programming journey, part self-study curriculum, part tutorial, and mainly my own barely coherent ramblings. I'm not really writing it with any audience in mind, but just as a way to focus and direct my own extracurricular computer science endeavors.

My goal is to post here once a month. September, check!

Right now here's the slate of topics I am interested in:
- Machine Learning
- Transformers
- Building blocks of computers
- The internet
... and more! Right now I don't really know where this is going to go or what my focus will be. It will be a fun journey and I hope to learn a lot along the way, and maybe discover a true passion for working with computers while I'm at it.

If you want to get in touch about anything I've written here please reach out to me at thomashsutter@gmail.com!
